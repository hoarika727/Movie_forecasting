# Movie_forecasting
Inspired from a data analytics class, I expand the  movie forecasting project to a more plausible and updated analysis.

I web scraped the movie data from Box Office MOJO by IMDbPro between the years of 2000 and 2019, re-formatted the runtime and the date with the corresponding year of release, and extracted the link related to the specified movie.
